Open-Source Contributions
=========================

During the time as PhD candidate, multiple open-source Python packages were developed.

These include the spatial data processing and subsurface toolbox **GemGIS**, the heat demand processing tool
**PyHeatDemand** and the borehole data processing tool **PyBorehole**.

With the engagement in the open-source software community, I am also a member of the `Software Underground <https://softwareunderground.org/>`_. You can find me on their `Mattermost Platform <https://mattermost.softwareunderground.org/swung>`_ under the handle @alexanderjuestel.
Further, I am supporting (and receiving great support from) the `pyOpenSci community <https://www.pyopensci.org/>`_. If you have questions regarding open-source Python packages, you can ping me on their `Slack Workspace <pyopensci.slack.com>`_ under the handle @Alexander JÃ¼stel.
